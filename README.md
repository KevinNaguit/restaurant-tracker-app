# restaurant-tracker-app

This project was developed as part of the Web Development Diploma program at Concordia University. The Restaurant Tracker App helps you keep track of restaurants you've visited or want to try, organized by lists and tags.

## Features

**User Accounts:**

Sign up or log in to save your restaurants privately.

**Dashboard:**

 Access your main hub with three sections:
 
- Favourites: Restaurants you love.
- Want to Try: Restaurants you plan to visit.
- Tags: Organize restaurants with tags like "Sushi" or "Italian".

**Add Restaurant:**

Easily add details like name, address, website, and personal notes, and choose whether to save them to Favourites or Want to Try.

**Tags Management:**

Create and manage tags to filter restaurants.

**Planned Feature:**

A future update will add Search and Filter options for easy browsing based on tags.
